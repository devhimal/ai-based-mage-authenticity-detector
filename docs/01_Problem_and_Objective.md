## 1. Problem Understanding & Objective

### 1.1. The Deepfake Image Problem

The proliferation of "deepfakes"—synthetic images generated by deep learning techniques, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—presents a significant societal challenge. These highly realistic, fabricated images can be used for malicious purposes, including disinformation campaigns, reputational damage, fraud, and the creation of non-consensual explicit content. The ease with which these can be created and distributed undermines trust in digital media and poses a threat to personal and public security.

### 1.2. Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust, academically sound **binary classification system** capable of distinguishing between authentic (Real) and synthetically generated (Deepfake) images. The solution will leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and will be developed and executed in a local environment, adhering to a zero-budget constraint by utilizing publicly available datasets and open-source software.
